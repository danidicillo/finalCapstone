# This project is called "finalCapstone"

# The repository contains two projects. The projects are named as follows:
# 1) semantic.py
# 2) watch_next.py

# The projects are about Semantic Similarity, an application of spaCy's Python Library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

# The first project has three parts. The first part and second show two ways to compare words with one another. In both cases,
# it uses the nlp() command to do the comparison. But the second part is about "Working with vectors" and consists in comparing
# the words of a list with one another. It takes each word as a token and compares it to the others using a Nested For Loop.
# The third part is about "Working with sentences". It compares a sentence with several sentences in a list. The comparison is
# made by using two different English models, the "en_core_web_sm" and the "en_core_web_md".
# The only file you need to download to run the application is semantic.py.

# The first part of the first project shows the similarity's scores and looks like:

# The second project is a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of movies. 
# Using NLP for semantic similarity the code compares the description of a movie you have watched with a list of descriptions of other movies. 
# This is the way to recommend other movies based on their descriptions such as Netflix's recommendation system works.
# To run the application you need to download the files called watch_next.py and movies.txt.
